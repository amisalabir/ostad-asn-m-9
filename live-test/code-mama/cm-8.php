Problem Statement
Write a program to find the minimum value in a rotated sorted array using binary search algorithm. If a sorted array is like {0,1,2,4,5,6,7} then the rotated sorted array can be {4,5,6,7,0,1,2}.

Input
The program will take an integer 
�
N as the size of a rotated sorted array. Then it will take the integer values of the array 
�
[
]
M[].

Output
The output will print the minimum integer number from the array.

Constraints
0 ≤ |N| ≤ 100000
0 ≤ |M[]| ≤ 100000
Example:
Enter numbers

Problem Statement
Write a program to find the index of a target value in a rotated sorted array using binary search algorithm. If a sorted array is like {0,1,2,4,5,6,7} then the rotated sorted array can be {4,5,6,7,0,1,2}.

Input
The program will take an integer 
�
N as the size of a rotated sorted array. Then it will take the integer values of the array 
�
[
]
M[]. Finally, it will take the target value 
�
P

Output
The output will print either the index of the target element or "Element not found" if the element is not found.

Constraints
0 ≤ |N| ≤ 100000
0 ≤ |M[]| ≤ 100000
0 ≤ |P| ≤ 100000
Example-1:
Enter numbers

Input:

/*
 Problem Statement
Write a program to approximate the square root of a non-negative integer using binary search. Your function should return an integer representing the floor of the square root. For example, for 6 it will print 2.

Input
The input consists of an integers 
�
N.

Output
The output will print the square root integer value of the input.

Constraints
0 ≤ |N| ≤ 10000
Example:
Enter number
